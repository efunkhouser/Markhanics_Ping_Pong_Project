Markhanics_Ping_Pong_Project
============================

This is the base repository for the final Mechanics: ModSim Approach project of Eleanor Funkhouser and Zoher Ghadyali. We are modeling the spin and impact of a ping pong ball in order to ascertain what amount of backspin is necessary to have the ball land on the other side of the court and spin backwards over the net.
